# Application integration

Own assigned concept registration, instance construction, composition, assembly, configuration, boundary projection, hosting, generated-artifact commands, and integration tests. Use public package subpaths and the supplied declarations.

## Register concepts and instances

Import each approved Markdown specification as text. Register the raw implementation class and map every declared refusal code to its stable error class:

```ts
import { conceptSet, registerConcept } from "@mit-sdg/sync-engine/assembly";
import spec from "@design/concepts/Posting.md" with { type: "text" };
import { InvalidContent, PostingConcept } from "./concepts/Posting.ts";

const posting = registerConcept({
  class: PostingConcept,
  spec,
  refusals: { INVALID_CONTENT: InvalidContent },
});

export const applicationConceptSet = conceptSet({ Posting: posting });
```

Do not wrap, adapt, or subclass a concept merely for registration. When specializing a generic class, preserve the application-specific class name and authored external-type binding. Register each selected static instance once under its authored identity; do not reuse one raw instance under two identities or invent an undeclared instance.

For default-constructible concepts, assemble with fresh registered implementations:

```ts
import { assemble } from "@mit-sdg/sync-engine/assembly";
import { applicationConceptSet } from "./concepts.ts";
import { composition } from "./composition.ts";

assemble({
  conceptSet: applicationConceptSet,
  instances: applicationConceptSet.implementations(),
  composition,
});
```

## Realize selected declarations

Implement only declarations selected by exact authored links. An endpoint is the reaction named by its `reaction:` link and uses the pathname from its matching endpoint entry. A separate internal reaction requires its own link. Keep module, group, declaration, computation, and path identities aligned.

Composition coordinates owners but does not absorb their invariants or make them atomic. Implement required effects before acknowledgement unless approved failure semantics say otherwise. Give retries a stable identity accepted by the effect owner and implement the designed recovery action.

Hosts project the boundary and contain no product policy. Never build a request router outside the `@mit-sdg/sync-engine-http` handler and policy. A host may wrap the handler in `Bun.serve` but must not match paths itself. A supplied transport owns its routing, wire, and error policy; do not duplicate it with a hand-written router or direct concept calls.

Treat source-agreement diagnostics as contract mismatches rather than hiding them with alternate wiring. Run generation through the project command and never edit generated files. Use the generated core wire for gateways; transport projections are caller contracts, not assembly input.
