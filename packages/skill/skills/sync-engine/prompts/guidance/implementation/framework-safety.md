# Framework use

Implement from supplied public references, named package-owned public documentation or examples, generated caller contracts, and ordinary project diagnostics. Do not browse package trees for alternatives.

Never inspect package `dist`, framework internals, runtime exports, caches, sibling applications, or declarations not explicitly supplied as public context. Never import from `node_modules/` or `dist/` paths. A diagnostic may name an internal file; use the diagnostic without opening it.

Repair ordinary diagnostics through the project checks. When supplied material does not determine the next API shape, try at most one directly supported repair, then report a context or design blocker instead of trying speculative variants.
