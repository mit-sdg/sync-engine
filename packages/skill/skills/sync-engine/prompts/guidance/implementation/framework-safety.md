# Framework use

Implement from supplied public references, named package-owned public documentation or examples, generated caller contracts, and ordinary project diagnostics. Do not browse package trees for alternatives.

Never inspect package `dist`, framework internals, runtime exports, caches, sibling applications, or declarations not explicitly supplied as public context. Never import from `node_modules/` or `dist/` paths. A diagnostic may name an internal file; use the diagnostic without opening it.

Apply at most one repair directly supported by the available material. If the same diagnostic remains or the next API shape is undetermined, report a context or design blocker instead of trying speculative variants.
