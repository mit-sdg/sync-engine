# Contract design and review

Use the supplied decomposition as boundary authority; without one, use the brief and affected approved contracts. Preserve accepted obligation IDs and their trigger, closing reaction, false interval, retry identity, and recovery.

## Concepts own complete mechanisms

Purpose names one mechanism and rules out a plausible alternative. Principle gives a short event-ordered story with real actors and values. State describes observable identity, relations, lifecycle, order, multiplicity, and invariants—not storage. External identities remain opaque and peer facts are never interpreted locally.

For every action, settle:

- inputs and returned identity;
- successful state transition;
- each expected refusal and the unchanged post-refusal state;
- repetition or deduplication behavior;
- lifecycle stage, deletion, expiry, and repair when applicable; and
- the owner action that enforces each race-sensitive or security-critical invariant.

A refusal has no partial effect. Repetition must succeed again, return the prior result, or refuse. Deduplication requires an operation identity accepted and checked atomically by the owner; a trace correlation ID is not enough.

Queries have no effects. State `one`, `optional`, or `many`, the empty or unknown case, and stable ordering for `many`. Do not invent CRUD symmetry or expose storage operations that are not part of the mechanism.

## Composition coordinates without stealing authority

Composition owns cross-concept policy, coordination, boundary adaptation, and recovery—not concept invariants. For each visible flow, state:

- actor and authenticated authority;
- requested resource and authorization condition;
- enforcement point;
- visible success and refusals;
- effect owner;
- ordering of required effects relative to acknowledgement; and
- material partial-failure and recovery behavior.

Request data is a claim, not authentication. Reject bypassable authorization, duplicate effect ownership, required work deferred after visible success when it can be lost, compensation without an available owner action, and claims of atomic or exactly-once behavior across independent owners.

For each obligation, verify that the trigger can occur, the closing reaction owns the intended effect, the owner accepts the retry identity, the false interval matches visible behavior, and recovery can run from an available action. This applies to synchronously awaited endpoint steps as well as deferred reactions. Never assume rollback between owners or exactly-once network delivery. Choose and state a realizable server-side acknowledgement boundary rather than adding protocol state solely to model whether a client received bytes.

## Select every executable explicitly

Inventory each selected static instance, endpoint, internal reaction, view, former, and computation. Give every executable declaration one exact typed link, and put all concrete types and instances needed by a new application in `design/types.md`. Each endpoint additionally needs exactly one matching `Declaration.Identity at /path` entry. The module, group, declaration, and pathname must agree.

An endpoint-linked reaction may own the full coordination required before its answer. Add a separate internal reaction only for intentionally distinct deferred or independently triggered behavior. Do not duplicate one effect in both declarations.

Contracts specify behavior, ownership, acknowledgement, and failure—not framework stages, trigger syntax, binding flow, host methods, status codes, or storage layout.
