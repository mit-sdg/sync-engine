# Reading Simple State Form

State fences are declarations, not storage. Read them for what they promise:

- `a set of Items` and `a seq of Items` introduce identities; a `seq` also fixes order.
- A plain set holds every individual of its type in the state: with `a set of Users with
a reputation Number`, every User anywhere in the concept has a reputation, whether
  User is owned or external. An external type's set introduces no identity.
- `a set of Completed Items` classifies members of `Items`, and `a set of Late Completed
Items` members of `Completed Items`. A subset declares no second collection and no
  identity, subsets may overlap, and `a reviewer Verified User` holds only members of
  `Verified Users`.
- `an Author` is the field `author`; the type names a field written without a name.
- `an optional owner Person` may be absent. Collections never carry `optional`; empty
  means absent, so a set that must reject duplicates cannot also promise to detect them.
- `an element Settings` has exactly one member.
- `alias WorkItem for Items` renames one declaration; it adds nothing.
- A `Rule:` line is prose the checker keeps verbatim and proves nothing.

Which side declares a relation implies no storage, navigation, or ownership.
