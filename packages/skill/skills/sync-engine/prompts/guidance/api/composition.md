# Composition declarations

`@mit-sdg/sync-engine/language` declares reactions, views, formers and computations;
`@mit-sdg/sync-engine/boundary` declares endpoints. Declaration does not execute:
`assemble` from `@mit-sdg/sync-engine/assembly` registers what these produce.

Import an approved specification through the `@design` alias, which the installed
`tsconfig.json` maps to the design root: `import spec from "@design/concepts/Name.md" with
{ type: "text" }`. `generated.config.ts` lists only the application documents,
`design/types.md` and `design/compositions/*.md`, as URLs written
`new URL("./design/types.md", import.meta.url)`. Concept specifications enter through
`registerConcept({ spec })` and are never listed there; the application-design loader
rejects a concept file with "types fence accepts only `concrete Name` declarations".

## Reactions

`reaction`, `when`, `where`, `returned`, `refused`, `no`, `whether`, `earlier`, `now` and
`is` come from `@mit-sdg/sync-engine/language`.

```ts
reaction(({ author, post }) =>
  when(Posting.publish({ author }).responds({ post })).then(Indexing.add({ item: post })),
);
```

- A trigger is one callable action line or one outcome channel, followed by optional
  `.where(...)` conditions and `.then(...)` consequences. `action(input)` alone matches the
  request; `.responds(output?)` and `.refuses(output?)` match the outcome.
- `returned(pattern?, { by?, except?, exceptBy? }?)` and `refused(...)` match an action's
  outcome and may be the trigger themselves, as in
  `when(returned({ post }, { by: "Posting.publish" }))`. `where(...)` takes conditions;
  `no(readLine)` and `whether(readLine)` test one.
- `earlier(action, input, output?)` refers to a prior occurrence.
- `now(variable)` binds the instant stamped on this flow's outermost occurrence, so every
  reaction in one flow reads one time and a caller can author none. Pass that variable to
  each action needing the instant; never model a clock as a concept.
- `is.lt`, `is.le`, `is.gt`, `is.ge`, `is.among` compare.
- `.afterFlowSettles()` may follow `when(trigger)` or a completed stage, then `.then(step)`
  or `.where(...).then(step)`. A chained deferred stage accepts condition lines only.

Each composition module exports one `composition` record of named groups, and `assemble`
receives those records keyed by module:

```ts
export const composition = { Publishing: { PublishPost, IndexOnPublish } };
```

An authored link names the same three parts: `reaction:Board.Publishing.IndexOnPublish`
requires module `Board`, group `Publishing` and declaration `IndexOnPublish`. Read the
approved design's links and use those exact names; `MISSING_COVERAGE` reports a selected
declaration no link names.

## Views, formers and computations

`view`, `former`, `form`, `each`, `count` and `compute` come from the same subpath.

```ts
view(name, (input, output, free) => where(...)).holds();
view(name, (input, output, free) => where(...)).one();
former(name, (input, free) => form({ ...shape }));
former(name, (input, free) => where(...).form({ ...shape }));
```

- A view's `.holds()`, `.one()`, `.optional()`, or `.many()` follows the closing
  `view(...)`; it is never called on `where(...)`.
- Builders receive binding bags. Reading a property, including by destructuring, declares a
  stable logic variable in that partition. Bind query outputs with `.is({ ... })`; do not
  destructure the query call itself:

  ```ts
  const targetFor = view("target for (code)", ({ code }, { target }, _free) =>
    where(Shortening._resolve({ code }).is({ target })),
  ).one();
  ```

  Completed views and formers take one object-shaped input mapping.

- A view with no output binding is a predicate and ends in `.holds()`. A view that binds
  output rows returns `.many()` by default and may state `.one()` or `.optional()` instead.
  Stacked `where` blocks are alternatives, and local bindings do not escape the view.
- `each(readLine).where(...).arranged(...)` then a consumer:

| Consumer           | Result                                     | Empty selection |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| `.form({ ... })`   | one record per row                         | `[]`            |
| `.count()`         | number of rows                             | `0`             |
| `.first(value)`    | value from the first row after arrangement | `null`          |
| `.distinct(value)` | first-seen distinct values                 | `[]`            |

- A `form({ ...shape })` entry may be a bound variable, another formed node, or portable
  JSON literal data. Use literals directly for constant fields and structures; do not add a
  computation solely to produce a constant. Functions, symbols, `undefined`, non-finite
  numbers, class instances, and cyclic values are not portable literals.
- `form({ ...shape }).splicing(...formerUses)` merges record-rooted fragments into a host
  record. Every variable a fragment input references must already be bound, and fragment
  keys must not collide with host or earlier-fragment keys. A plain optional fragment drops
  the host row when absent; `whether(...)` keeps it and fills its leaves with `null`.
- `count(query, input, outputVariable)` requires one non-union query reference and its
  complete input mapping; undeclared fields are rejected recursively.
- `compute(named, input, output)` is a condition line inside `where(...)`. It runs a pure
  function supplied as `conceptSet`'s optional second argument and exposed as
  `set.computations`; it never takes a bare function. A variable output binds the complete
  result. For a record-shaped, non-array result, an object output pattern binds or tests
  several fields, including nested fields, and each variable remains wire-traceable through
  its return-type path. Write
  `conceptSet({ ... }, { describe: ({ value }) => ({ label: String(value), rank: 1 }) })`,
  then `compute(set.computations.describe, { value }, { label, rank })`. A no-input
  computation uses `{}`. `is` exposes `.lt`, `.le`, `.gt`, `.ge`, and `.among`; test a
  computed boolean with `is.among(live, [true])` or `is.among(live, [false])`. Build the
  computation record before the set; references from separate sets do not mix.
- A query's `"one" | "optional" | "many"` promise links to a record return for `"one"` and
  an array of records otherwise, at type level and at runtime.

## Endpoints

`endpoint`, `receive` and `respond` come from `@mit-sdg/sync-engine/boundary`.

An endpoint is itself a selected reaction. Its design carries both a `reaction:` link and
an `endpoints` entry with the same module, group, and declaration name:

```text
Publishing a post [enters the application](reaction:Board.Publishing.PublishPost).
```

```endpoints
Board.Publishing.PublishPost at /board/post
```

Use that exact identity and path in the declaration and placement:

```ts
const PublishPost = endpoint(
  "/board/post",
  ({ author, content, post }) =>
    receive({ author, content })
      .then(Posting.publish({ author, content }).responds({ post }))
      .then(respond({ post })),
  { input: { required: ["author", "content"] } },
);

export const composition = { Publishing: { PublishPost } };
```

and register that composition under its linked module:

```ts
assemble({
  conceptSet: applicationConceptSet,
  instances: applicationConceptSet.implementations(),
  composition: { Board: composition },
});
```

Do not wrap the endpoint in another reaction. Do not declare an endpoint unless its exact
reaction link and endpoint entry exist in approved design. Conversely, every selected
public endpoint must have both before implementation begins.

- Paths must be canonical absolute URL pathnames that survive WHATWG pathname handling
  unchanged. Queries, fragments, scheme-relative paths, dot segments, malformed percent
  escapes, literal spaces and literal Unicode are rejected.
- `receive(...)` cannot author `path` or `requestId`; `respond(...)` cannot author
  `requestId` or `errorKind`.
- A stage may state `.afterFlowSettles()` to form its response at a settlement frontier; add
  conditions identifying the terminal state the endpoint requires.
- Sibling answers are alternatives, not ordered fall-through: an unconditional sibling
  overlaps every conditional one, and an endpoint records at most one answer. Give each
  branch a condition that excludes the others. Branching on whether an optional input was
  supplied needs a declared computation; if the design declares none, block rather than
  invent one.
- A binding produced by a state read belongs to the stage that consumes it. It does not
  safely cross an intervening action. Consume it before the action, return it from an
  owning action, or read it again in the later stage.
- Validators are explicit: `input`, `output` and `domainError`, each returning
  `{ ok: true } | { ok: false; detail?: string }` synchronously, at most once per path. The
  domain-error validator receives the response's top-level `error`. Generated types carry no
  runtime schema semantics.
- `InputContractDecl` takes `required` (a missing listed key returns `INVALID_INPUT`) and
  `defaults` (filled only when a key is absent). Without one, assembly intersects the keys
  every exported `receive(...)` for that path mentions. An explicit contract replaces that
  rather than merging, and only one may declare it per path. It must leave one `receive`
  alternative reachable: every key that alternative mentions is `required` or carries a
  matching default, or assembly refuses the path. A second alternative differing only by
  an omitted key is the invention the sibling rule forbids.
